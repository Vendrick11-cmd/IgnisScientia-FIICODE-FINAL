Eleanore: The forest warned me about new, enstranged footsteps. I knew you were coming.
- Are you the one they call Eleanore?
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: Are you Eleanore?
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: Names come and go. That one's still warm though. Let's say yes, for now.
- You knew I was coming?
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: How did you know I was coming?
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: The wind of these forests know more than it lets on. And you carry questions like burrs on your cape.
- Am I interrupting something?
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: I'm sorry, am I interrupting something?
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: Only silence. And that's always easy to break.
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: So! You've come all this way, and still you haven't said why.
- I am seeking knowledge. The old kind.
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: I am looking for knowledge, the old kind.
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: Then you will need older ears than mine. But I can point you toward whispers.
- They told me you could teach me.
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: They told me you could teach me.
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: They always do. Still... maybe you are worth the telling.
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: You can be sure I am.
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: We will see about that.
- I do not know yet.
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: I... do not entirely know yet.
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: That is better than thinking you do, so do not fret.
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: Ancient knowledge does not sit in books. It grows, hides, waits to be coaxed. And sometimes it even bites.
- So? Where do I begin?
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: Where do I begin?
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: Begin by staying. Observe, breathe. The forest might speak to you yet if you truly wish to be here. In time, you will know where to step.
- What do I need to do?
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: What do I need to do?
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: Begin by staying. Observe, breathe. The forest might speak to you yet if you truly wish to be here. In time, you will know where to step.
- That is a poetic way to say nothing.
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: Thanks for saying nothing so poetically. 
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: And yet you stayed to listen. Perhaps you are more patient than you let on... but you just do not know it yet.
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: Out back, there is soil. It has been waiting.
Eleanore: You may plant what you find. Or what finds you. Pay attention to how things grow... and how they do not.

do _eleanore()
Eleanore: What are you waiting for?
- You want me to grow plants?
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: Do you want me to grow plants?
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: Want is a strong word, but yes. You'll need their trust before you can wield them.
- ...Are you always this vague?
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: Are you always like this? Like this vague?
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: Only when I'm being honest.
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: Stay. Learn. Grow. And when you feel ready... the old stones beneath this forest have more to say.

~ EleanoreDrake
do _pause()
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: You’re picking things up faster than I expected. Perhaps there’s more to you than dirt and determination.
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: I've had worse compliments. Something on your mind?
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: There is... someone. A hunter named Drake. He’s from these woods, knows every bend in the river, every stubborn root. Or at least... he did. He hasn’t been by in days.
- Sounds like trouble. Want me to help?
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: Sounds like trouble. Want me to look for him?
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: Only if you’ve time while staying around this land. But yes. I’d appreciate that.
- Maybe he just wandered off.
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: Maybe he just wandered off. Hunters like space, don’t they?
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: Drake is a man of space, yes. But he never breaks a promise. Not without a reason. He was meant to bring me sprigs from the ridge three days ago.
- Who's he more exactly?
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: What’s he to you?
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: A thorn in my side. And sometimes a flower, if he remembers how.
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: Look, I know this isn’t what you came here for, but if you do find him, just... make sure he's not face-down in a briar patch somewhere.
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: I'll keep an eye out. No promises, though.
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: I wouldn’t ask for promises. Just eyes, and maybe a little luck. The woods are kind to those who tread gently.

~ EleanoreEnd
do _pause()
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: Back in one piece. That's either talent, or the dungeon took pity on you.
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: I'll take pity. Easier on the bones. Anyway, Drake's fine. Bit singed, but alive.
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: You found him?
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: Found him sitting by a fire like nothing happened. Said he was trapped in a room and he couldn't get out. Classic hunter nonsense.But he's breathing and grumbling, so I call that a success.
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: Good. That’s... good to hear.
- You care about him, huh?
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: You care about him pretty much, huh?
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: Care is a strong word. Let's say I'm accustomed to his silence.
- He said not to fuss over him, by the way.
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: He said not to fuss over him, you know.
	do _eleanore()
	Eleanore: Of course he did. And I'm sure he thinks that stops me.
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: You've done well, Hemwick. You learned more than just roots and remedies here.
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: When the road ahead get darker, and it will, remember that light doesn't always come from the sun.
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: One more thing...
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: Thank you. For walking with us. For now, this is where the trail ends. You are free to continue growing and maintaining the soil with diverse plants you find.
do _eleanore()
Eleanore: The fire's still warm... and the story is far from over.
