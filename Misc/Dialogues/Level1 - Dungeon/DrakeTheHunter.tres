Hemwick: Well, I was expecting a pile of bones and a scrap of a journal. This is better.
do _drake()
Drake: You took your time.
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: Excuse me for not sprinting through the charming undead welcoming committee.
do _drake()
Drake: And here I thought they'd break you in two.
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: They tried. I'm flexible.
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: Eleanore sent me to find you. I suppose you are Drake, the hunter. She's worried.
do _drake()
Drake: She shouldn't be.
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: Try telling her that. She hides it like poison in tea, but it's there.
do _drake()
Drake: ...Told her not to fuss. Figures she would.
- Why didn't you try to find a way out?

	Hemwick: Why didn't you try to find a way out?
	do _drake()
	Drake: This wall enclosed right behind me as I entered this room. Now it has opened, but there are monsters outside. It was a trap.
	do _hemwick()
	Hemwick: What were you even doing down here?
	do _drake()
	Drake: Following a scent. Something's stirring below these stones. I came to find the source.
do _drake()
Drake: Well, you found me. And I'm still breathing, for now. That enough for you?
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: For Eleanore, maybe. For me? I was hoping you'd offer a snack or something.
do _drake()
Drake: All I've got is silence unfortunately.
