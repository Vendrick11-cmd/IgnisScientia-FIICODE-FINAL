Willy: Well, I be damned... Look who decided to stumble back in. Thought the road had swallowed you whole, Hemwick.
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: Long time, no see, Willy! Did not let it. Not this time.
do _willy()
Willy: Hah! Always were too stubborn to stay down. What has it been? Months? A year? Feels like longer.
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: Long enough. Place has not changed much.
do _willy()
Willy: Neither have you. Same tattered cloak, same tired look. Though, I would wager you have got some new scars under all that.
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: A few. 
do _willy()
Willy: Figures. You always come back worse for wear. First round is on the house. Consider it a welcome back gift.
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: Appreciated.
do _willy()
Willy: So, what brings you back? Looking for trouble, or just a place to rest your bones?
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: Both.
do _willy()
Willy: Hah! Thought so. Well, you picked the right place. Folk come through here with all sorts of problems, ones that need a blade, a sharp mind, or both. You looking for work, I can point you in the right direction.
do _hemwick()
Hemwick: I am listening.
do _willy()
Willy: Good. Finish your drink, then we talk. Got some folk who would be glad to have someone like you handling their business. Just a matter of picking which mess you want to step into first.
